## Wha is bus-mall

**`a catalog of assorted high-markup products provided to a captive audience seeking a mental escape from the drudgery of travel. The difference with BusMall is that instead of their catalog being placed in airplanes, they are placed on local busses while commuting through traffic.Since the catalogs are expensive to print and distribute, and the products cost money to make and warehouse, and BusMall is a lean startup that needs to carefully watch its expenditures, BusMall wants to feature only the items in its sell that are the most likely to feature .This means that BusMall wants to do market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interest ... before actually putting them into the catalog and getting the manufacturing wheels in motion.**`
